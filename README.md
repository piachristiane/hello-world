# hello-world
my first Git-hub repository
It has been a while since I coded anything, but it is really nice to understand the new tools for version control. Somethings has happened since 10 years ago..

I am a product manager, and when I thrive the most is when I can be a part of a team and solve complex problems that delight our customers. 
I have crossed different types of organizations and different way of working over the last 10 years in my proffetional life.  
I have been in finance, consulting and in defence. All doing different stuff that eventually results in some sw development. 
I have had several different roles during my career both as a manager and as an individual contributer. 
My motivation increases when I scense there is a true issue our customers are experiencing and together with the developers, we find a way to solv the problem!
